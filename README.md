# Osmium helix

All credits to the massive brain of ![IroncladDev](https://github.com/ironcladdev) for the initial
theme for nvim.

This is the literal just same translation but for helix instead.

I wanted this cause I have both neovim and helix and sometimes I like to pretend I'm that cool that
I can use both, but I can't because I'm legally actually declared stupid.
